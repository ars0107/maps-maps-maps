After selecting a data set from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php, I used the url for the JSON object to visualize a map. 

Using Leaflet, all objects from the data were plotted based on their longitude and latitude while adhering to the following instructions:
<ul>
  <li>Data markers should reflect the magnitude of the earthquake in their size and color. Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger and darker in color</li>
  <li>Include popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked</li>
  <li>Create a legend that will provide context for your map data</li>
</ul>
